### About

[The Nintaco NES/Famicom emulator](https://nintaco.com/) provides [a Go API](https://github.com/meatfighter/nintaco-go-api) that enables externally running programs to control the emulator at a very granular level. This example enhances *Castlevania*, providing the ability to swap subweapons at the press of a button.
